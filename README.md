# dfns-figment-stake-sol

This repository demonstrates how to use Figment's API to stake SOL from DFNS wallet tech. 

Configure your .env file the same way you would in [this repo](https://github.com/dfns/dfns-sdk-ts/tree/m/examples/libs/solana/staking) and add your Figment API key under `FIGMENT_API_KEY`. Find Figment's API authentication instructions [here](https://docs.figment.io/reference/authentication).
